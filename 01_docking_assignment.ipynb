    "Scholar is a compute cluster that designed for use in classes like ours. It is configured in much the same ways as other community compute clusters maintained by RCAC at Purdue. Currently (Spring 2024) there are several clusters used for research:\n",
    " - Negishi - Cluster built in 2022 that is focused on CPU-only calculations. Cluster access is possible by purchasing nodes.\n",
    " - Gilbreth - Cluster built in that is focused on GPU-enabled applications like machine learning. Cluster access is possible by purchasing nodes.\n",
    " - Anvil - Massive cluster built in NSF-funded project. Cluster access is controlled through [ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/).\n",
    "More info about compute clusters at Purdue is available at [RCAC's website](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute).\n",

There are many methods for modeling missing structures, but we will run [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/) directly through Chimera. To fix the missing sections, go to Tools -> Surface Editing -> Model/Refine Loops. Two dialogue boxes will appear"
