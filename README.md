# Docking activities in CHM696

CHM696 - Chemical Biology is a graduate-level chemistry course taught at Purdue University focused on the concepts and techniques used by chemical biologists. Small-molecule/protein interactions are of particular interest, so computational approaches to predict effective ligand binding can be powerful tools to guide experimentation. For the final problem set of the course, students will conduct ligand docking and virtual screening to identify new leads.

## Docking tutorial

Usage of Dock 6.11 is introduced in a model system: the complex of EGFR with gefitinib.
